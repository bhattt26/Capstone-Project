I have a dataset that contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. 
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, 
the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

We have build a classification model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

The following task I have done in this project:
1. Impoted reuired liraries
2. EDA
3. Feature scaling
4. Checkind data imbalance
5. Handled imbalanced datah.
6. Model Selection and deployment.
7. Evaluation of Model.
